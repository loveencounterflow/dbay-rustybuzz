# 𓆤DBay 𓏞RustyBuzz

*There's no documentation, yet, just [demos, tests,
benchmarks,](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/hengist/tree/master/dev/dbay-rustybuzz/src) and a few
scattered notes*

## Notes

### General Procedure


* **Prepare**
  * Initialize
  * Normalize text (replacing e.g. symbols like `&shy;`, `&wbr;` with their Unicode equivalents etc.)
  * Split into paragraphs
  * Hyphenate
  * Register fonts in DB and in `rustybuzz-wasm`

* **Arrange** (`shape_text()`). Translate text to a series of `( x, y )`-positioned glyfs (a.k.a. shapes
  or outlines, identified by numerical Glyf IDs (GIDs)). Input is (possibly hyphenated) text, output is a
  series of positioned Arrangement Data items (ADs) *on a single, long line*.

* **Distribute** (`distribute()`). Given the metrics of a paragraph (i.e. line lengths) and shaped text
  (in the form of ADs), break text into individual lines by looking for good points in the ADs (spaces,
  hyphens, WBRs) where line wrapping may occur. Input is ADs and shape of paragraph, output is in tables
  `lines`, `line_ads` with line numbers and corrected coordinates.

* **Compose** (`compose()`)
  * **XXX** Update table `outlines` with the outlines of all glyfs needed for composition
  * **YYY** write HTML+SVG

* Arrangement and composition is currently done per glyf / outline /
  ['sort'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(typesetting)) (German, interestingly:
  ['Letter'](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter)) but it could conceivably also be done per word, per
  shape group (SG), or per 'syllable'. Using a bigger unit than the glyf for composition allows to reduce
  the number of `<use/>` tags needed, at the cost of having intermediary `<use/>` tags. Where we now have
  `<use/>` tags that refer directly to outlines defined as `<path/>` elements, we'd then build lines with
  `<use/>` tags that represent entire (parts of) words; words and parts thereof are in turn defined as
  series of relatively positioned `<use/>` tags that themselves refer to `<path/>`s. Given a long enough
  text in a uniform font, `arrange()`/`shape_text()` would only have to be called for the ever decreasing
  portions of text that have not yet been arranged; whether this would lead to a more efficient / faster /
  space-saving process is an open question.


### IDs of SVG Paths / Glyf Outlines

* Shape IDs (SIDs)
  * identify unscaled outlines, each being an SVG path element that pictures a glyf outline in a 1000⨉1000
    em square.
  * initial letter `o` (**O**utline)
  * followed by decimal Glyf ID / `gid`
  * followed by `fontnick`; these must always start with a letter
  * `o${gid}${fontnick}`
  * Ex.: `o42foo` identifies a glyf outline with GID `42` from font `foo`

* Special SIDs
  * `o0${fontnick}` represents the [`.notdef`
    element](https://typedrawers.com/discussion/4199/best-practices-for-null-and-notdef) of a font
    `${fontnick}`; this will normally displayed by a highly visible rectangle with an overlayed text
    element.
  * `oshy-${fontnick}` represents U+00ad, the [soft hyphen (SHY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_hyphen)
    which is inserted manually or by using a hyphenating algorithm to signal positions in a text where line
    breaking may occur by inserting a hyphen.
  * `owbr-${fontnick}` represents U+200b, the [zero-width space
    (WBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space) which is inserted manually or by applying the
    [Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm(UAX#14)](https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/) to signal positions in a
    text where line breaking may occur without inserting a hyphen.
  * Normally SHYs and WBRs will not be output to the typeset SVG; when they are, they may be displayed as
    vertical or slanted lines.

### Selectable Text

Since printable text is rendered as SVG elements such as `<path/>`, text will not be selectable
unless special care is taken.

* We overlay the entire document with a single custom HTML `<textcontainer>` element.
* Inside this, each line of output text is represented by an absolutely positioned `<span>` element.
* The first line of each paragraph is preceded by an unclosed HTML5 `<p>` element.
* There must be no space between the `<span>`s or between a `<p>` and a `<span>`, which may either be
  achieved by putting them end-to-end, or else use HTML comments to hide a newline character (this latter
  option will only be used when more human-readable output is being called for).
* The final character of each `<span>` should be the one that would be used in absence of the line break,
  i.e. a space if the next line starts with a new word, and no space in the case of a hyphenated word.
* Therefore, depending on where a line break happens to occur, render `run-of-the-mill procedure` as
  * `<span>run-of-the-</span></span>mill procedure<span>` (`run-of-the-⏎mill procedure`)
  * `<span>run-of-the-mill </span></span>procedure<span>` (`run-of-the-mill⏎procedure`)
  * `<span>run-of-the-mill pro</span></span>cedure<span>` (`run-of-the-mill pro-⏎cedure`)
* Each page gets its own `<textcontainer>` element to provide a convenient reference point for relative
  coordinates. It turns out that when the user selects text crossing the boundaries of the block elements
  (as in `one </span> </textcontainer><textcontainer><span>two </span><span>three</span></textcontainer>`)
  they will get `one ⏎two three` with a *newline inserted where the page break was*. This is ideal since
  paragraph breaks are rendered as empty lines (two line breaks in a row); markup languages like MarkDown
  and the reformatting utilites of text editors alike will do the right thing in this case.
* All elements except `<textcontainer>` are in the CSS set to be non-selectable with `user-select: none;`.
* To summarize, in the copied text, paragraphs will appear as single lines, separated by blank lines (double
  newlines), and page breaks as single newlines.
* The spans must appear in logical, not geometric order, i.e. they must appear in the order the source text
  was intended to be read. The browser will take care of proper hilite: when one starts to mark text near
  the bottom of the page in the left hand column and moves the cursor over to the right, the hilites section
  will 'snap' to include the rest of the left column (after & below), and the beginning of the right column
  (before & above) the current cursor position (and thus include all of the text that logically comes
  between these two points).
* The text is sized, positioned and formatted such as to closely mimick the positions and sizes of the SVG
  outlines; it is given the CSS `transparent` color to make it invisible (unless when selected).
* As an aside, it does not seem to be possible to obtain full compatibility with the standard `<span>`
  element just by defining a custom element and declaring it to `display: inline;`; when text is copied
  across multiple such elements, line breaks will still be inserted by the browser.

```html
<textcontainer><!--?textcontainer-start?-->
<p><!--
--><span style='left:0mm;top:40mm;'>first line of text </span><!--
--><span style='left:00mm;top:50mm;'>second line-</span><!--
--><span style='left:50mm;top:40mm;'>of-text; third line </span><!--
--><span style='left:50mm;top:50mm;'>fourth line</span><!--
--><p><!--
--><span style='left:0mm;top:40mm;'>first line of text </span><!--

--><span style='left:50mm;top:50mm;'>fourth line</span>
<!--?textcontainer-end?--></textcontainer>
```

## DB Structure

* **table `ads`**:
  * **field `ads.gid`**: Glyf ID, the numeric ID of the respective glyf (outline, shape) in the current
    font. By convention and OTF specification, GID `0` is used to represent any codepoint that cannot be
    represented with the current font; many applications will show those as so-called 'tofus' (often a
    rectangle like ▯); beyond that, Glyf IDs are arbitrary and vary from font to font.
  * **fields `ads.b1`, `ads.b2`**: The indexes of the respective first bytes that correspond to the
    respective *current* and *next* ADs in the source text.
    * The `b1` value of an AD always equals the `b2` value of the preceding AD (except for the first AD in a
      paragraph, whose `b1` is always `0` without a predecessor); conversely, the `b2` value of AD always
      equals the `b1` of the succeeding AD (except for the last AD in a paragraph, whose `b2` always equals
      the byte length of the source text without a successor).
    * These constraints mean that fields `b1` and `b2` can be interpreted as implementing a doubly linked
      list; this is a simple ('single-track') linked list when only looking at layer `alt: 1` and a
    * The pair `( b1, b2 )` can not only be used to sort ADs such that they are in *logical order* ([for
          which see *Chapter 2.2: Unicode Design Principles* in *The Unicode Standard (v14)*,
          p19](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/ch02.pdf#G128)).
    * Since `byte_range := ( b1, b2 )` refers to a range of contiguous bytes in the source text, one can, by
      preserving the two fields across transformations, pinpoint, for any outline in the resulting output
      (HTML or PDF), the *exact location in the source text* that is responsible for the outline in
      question.
    * One may say that the coordinate tuple `( x1, x2 )` reifies (materializes) the *visual ordering*
      whereas the byte index tuple `( b1, b2 )` reifies the *logical ordering* of a given source text.

## To Do

* **[–]** [RustyBuzz-WASM] modify `glyph_to_svg_pathdata()` / `rectangle_from_bbox()` to return coordinates
  instead of ready-built SVG `<rect/>` as wee need those numbers to construct the line bounding box
* **[–]** [RustyBuzz-WASM] implement caching of font face in `glyph_to_svg_pathdata()` to avoid re-building
  it for each single outline; benchmark
* **[–]** Two independent imports of [RustyBuzz-WASM] will share state if they happen to import the same
  file
* **[+]** keep bounding box as `{ x, y, x1, y1, }` in outline table to make it easier to compute composite
  bounding box
* **[–]** [RustyBuzz-WASM] implement

  ```coffee
  despace_svg_pathdata = ( svg_pathda ) ->
    R = svg_pathda
    R = R.replace /([0-9])\x20([^0-9])/g, '$1$2'
    R = R.replace /([^0-9])\x20([0-9])/g, '$1$2'
    return R
  ```
* **[–]** [RustyBuzz-WASM] implement SVG path compression
* **[+]** allow to pass in custom instance of `rustybuzz-wasm` as `cfg.RBW` for testing purposes
* **[–]** [RustyBuzz-WASM] move to WASI to enable reading from file system &c:
  * https://github.com/topheman/webassembly-wasi-experiments#file-system-access
  * https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/654
  * `rustwasmc` doesn't allow file access for Rust versions >= 1.51, see
    https://github.com/second-state/rustwasmc#known-issues
  * https://www.secondstate.io/articles/wasi-access-system-resources/
  * https://blog.knoldus.com/hosting-wasm-modules-in-rust-easily-using-wasmi/
  * https://lib.rs/search?q=wasi
  * https://wasi.dev/
  * https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/WASI-documents.md
  * https://wasmer.io/
  * https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly#Nutzung_au%C3%9Ferhalb_des_Browsers
  * https://forum.holochain.org/t/wasmi-vs-wasmer/1929
* **[–]** document SVG construction principles
* **[–]** document SVG units (mm, px, implicit)
* **[–]** implement CSS scaling function (so `1mm` in CSS shows up as 1mm in rendering)
* **[–]** implement bbox display
* **[–]** rename `shape_text()` to `arrange()`:
  * `arrange() -> ads`: gets an arrangement of SIDs (`a`rrangement `d`ata item`s`); this called by
  * `compose() -> { known_ods, new_ods, missing_chrs, ads, fm, }`: turns an arrangement into a hitherto
    unnamed data structure that indicates which outlines to put where, which SIDs are known, which are new,
    which are missing from the current font, and fontmetrics
  * `distribute()`: distributes text over lines
* **[–]** [icql-dba-hollerith] update & rebrand as `dbay-hollerith`, removing peer dependency on `icql-dba`
* **[–]** Ensure that entire text gets reflected in SVG comments when so configured, even while omitting
  refs for whitespace.
* **[+]** [hengist] Implement a 'Glyf Grid' to see which outlines are mapped to which GIDs
